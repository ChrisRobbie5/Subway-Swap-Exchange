## Introduction

Subway Swap is a platform that allows users to swap various cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner. Unlike centralized exchanges, this platform does not rely on intermediaries, ensuring more security, privacy, and control over your assets.

## Features

- **Decentralized Trading**: Swap cryptocurrencies without relying on a central authority.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Utilizes smart contracts for secure and transparent transactions.
- **Multi-Token Support**: Supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and tokens.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for seamless trading experience.
- **Security**: Enhanced security features to protect users' funds and data.
- **Anonymity**: Trade without revealing personal information.

## How It Works

The Decentralized Crypto Swap Exchange leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to facilitate peer-to-peer trading. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step overview of how it works:

1. **Wallet Connection**: Users connect their cryptocurrency wallets to the exchange.
2. **Select Tokens**: Choose the cryptocurrencies or tokens they wish to swap.
3. **Set Terms**: Define the terms of the swap, such as the amount and price.
4. **Smart Contract Execution**: The swap terms are executed via a smart contract, ensuring trustless and transparent transactions.
5. **Transaction Completion**: Once the smart contract conditions are met, the tokens are swapped and transferred to the respective wallets.

## Architecture

The architecture of Subway Swap Exchange consists of several key components:

1. **Frontend**: The user interface where users interact with the exchange.
   - Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Connects to users' wallets using Web3.js.
   - Communicates with the backend via API calls.

2. **Backend**: The server-side logic that handles requests and interactions with the blockchain.
   - Developed using Node.js and Express.
   - Manages user sessions and transaction requests.

3. **Smart Contracts**: The core logic that executes swaps securely on the blockchain.
   - Written in Solidity.
   - Deployed on the Ethereum blockchain (or other compatible blockchains).

4. **Blockchain**: The decentralized ledger that records all transactions.
   - Transactions are immutable and transparent.
   - Ensures security and trustlessness.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- A compatible cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
- Access to an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Ropsten).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/chrisrobbie5/Subway_Swap_Exchange.git
   cd Subway_Swap_Exchange
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
   - Compile and deploy the smart contracts to your chosen Ethereum testnet.
   - Update the contract addresses in the frontend and backend configurations.

4. **Start the Backend Server**:
   ```sh
   npm run start:backend
   ```

5. **Start the Frontend Development Server**:
   ```sh
   npm run start:frontend
   ```

6. **Open the application**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Usage

### Connecting Wallet

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Connect your cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the application.
3. Authorize the connection and select the desired network.

### Swapping Tokens

1. Choose the tokens you want to swap from the dropdown menus.
2. Enter the amount and review the exchange rate.
3. Confirm the swap details and initiate the transaction.
